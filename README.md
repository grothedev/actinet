This is a web interface for a tag-based local discussion board. It's purpose is to serve as a tool that people can use to partake in free discussion on any combination of topics with people around them. 

The reason I decided to make this software is I can see that we humans need a platform to talk about how to handle society. We are at a point in human evolution where we have realized that we people need to come together and change society ourselves. We need to implement new systems, override the functions of old systems (when I use the word "system" here, I am refering to things such as government, economy, education, transportation, energy extraction and distribution, etc.). 
The current forms of social media are not adequate. They have been corrupted and they are bloated with distractions. They try to serve too many functions and there is too much connection to a solid human identity. 

The idea behind this software is be as simple and minimal as possible, serving to maximize the effectiveness of the communication between humans, which will therefore also maximize the rate of positive social change. With a rich, dynamic post editor, as well as a threaded commenting system, this software can be used for in-depth discussion, to organize events, collaborate on projects and research, share files, and with the ability to post dynamic data structures, as well as its threaded commenting system, it is able to be easily shaped to serve future functions currently unknown. 

##Todo:
	- subscription for tags and users
	- add about section
	- tags and users searched for stay in input on page load
	- email verification	
	
###housekeeping:
	- double check min/max values for database items
	- stay at top of page when showing a post
	- spam prevention
	- API documentation

	
###once all that is done, it should be ready for initial use
	
	
	
then 

###UI overhaul
	- tags clickable to toggle
	- popular tags for query input with select2 js library
	- very dynamic and customizable data structure submission for posts and bio (rich but minimal text editor, embed files and images)


attach files
add location functionality
dynamic timezones


Future Plans:
	Eventually it will be decentralized, where people will host their own nodes to serve the application as well as store files people upload
	

##Some technical stuff
This website uses [Laravel](https://laravel.com/).
I am planning on implementing [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/)/[redux](http://redux.js.org/) for the UI overhaul.
